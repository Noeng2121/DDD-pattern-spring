⚙️ What is DDD?
DDD = Domain-Driven Design

It’s an approach to software design that focuses on the core business domain and its logic.
It was introduced by Eric Evans in his book "Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software."

The main idea is:

💡 "Your software should reflect the business.
Code is not just technical, it should model real-world problems."

⚙️ Principles of DDD :

✅ Model the real world in code
✅ Use Ubiquitous Language — Developers and business people speak the same terms
✅ Bounded Context — Separate parts of the system so they don’t mix up
✅ Keep domain logic in domain layer (not in controllers or infrastructure)

🎯 When to use DDD?
✅ Complex business domains
✅ Projects with a lot of rules & logic
✅ Long-term projects where understanding the domain is critical
🚫 Maybe not necessary for small CRUD apps or MVPs — it can feel too heavy.
